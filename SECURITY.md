## Supported Versions

None of versions can be considered as stable and fully supported yet.
Meanwhile, pre-release packages with recent changes will be continuously published to [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/iotbusters).

Pay attention, outdated packages can be unlisted from nuget. In that case, consider upgrading the package and check recent documentation.

Versions between packages may differ as they are being published only if the package or it's dependency was changed.
See [releases](https://github.com/iotbusters/assistant.net/releases) for details.
