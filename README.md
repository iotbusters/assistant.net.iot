# Assistant.NET IoT

Unfortunately existing solutions on a market didn't suit all needs or overcomplicated.
Beyond that, they weren't flexible enough to support new requirements further, so the solution is based on own tools.
Which although can be used as standalone packages too.

Currently, it's in design and implementation stage, so the repository contains mostly tools and infrastructure parts only.
Existing releases cannot be assumed as stable and backward compatible too, so pay attention during package upgrade!

Hopefully, it will be useful for someone once main functional is ready.
